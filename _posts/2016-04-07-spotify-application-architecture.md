The agile software development was introduced to focus more on individuals, interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to change. An agile team usually consists of 4 to 6 members including product owner, testers, designers, developers and agile coach. It is straightforward for smaller companies to apply.

As a company grows, you might wonder how to keep the agile. To scale the agile, Spotify forms multiple agile teams mostly based on features. However, each agile team's velocity would be restricted if there are dependencies for other teams. Those dependencies could come from an existing application architecture. In order to support a scaled agile, Spotify has changed an application architecture. Several ideas are borrowed from the most popular architecture, WWW(world wide web). In this talk, I describe how Spotify scales the agile and how we change the application architecture to support it.
